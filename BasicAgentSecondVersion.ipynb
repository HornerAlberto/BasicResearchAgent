      "MOFs are porous polymers that are classified as reticular materials, belonging to the subclass of coordination networks and coordination polymers. They have various applications such as gas storage, purification, and separation, and are the focus of reticular chemistry. In addition, there are also covalent organic frameworks (COFs) made of light elements. Recent studies have shown that organic molecular FETs can be used to study the properties of two-dimensional metals, and proposed experiments to investigate band-filling dependent cyclotron resonance and the effect of van Hove singularities. The use of quantum computing has the potential to accelerate the discovery of solid sorbents for direct air capture applications, but computational discovery is challenging due to the vast chemical search space and requirements for molecular selectivity. However, the Qubit-ADAPT-VQE technique has been used for simulations to predict gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks. Additionally, a general approach has been used to determine the first ionisation energy for six porous metal-organic frameworks.\n"
