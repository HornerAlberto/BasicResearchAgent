# BasicAgent
Basic research assistant agent inspired by the "Implementation of GenAI Agents" course (Coursera).

The file agent1.py retreives information from wikipedia and agent2.py retrieves information from both wikipedia and arxiv.

There are two notebooks to showcase a simple use of each agent. Feel free to fork and customize your agent!
